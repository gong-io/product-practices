# Gong Product Handbook

At the heart of this repository is the _Gong Product Handbook_.

We—the Gong product team—created this handbook in March 2020 to help us align around our practices, tools, and processes.

We tried to capture our practices and processes in a way that’s helpful to us, but also to outside readers, both internal (people at Gong) and external.

This handbook is neither complete nor static. We intend to expand it as we capture additional practices and find the time to document them, and evolve it as we grow our team.

The latest copy of the handbook can be found <https://nowhere.com|here>

# Templates

The Gong Product Handbook references several templates, which we use in our work. The templates are provided here in markdown format.
